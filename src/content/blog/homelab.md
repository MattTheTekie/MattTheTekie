## Beginnings
I'm currently in the process of redoing my workflow, and making it more proactive for my new desires. I got a lot of work to do, and one of them involves getting up a Home Lab. One of the things I need to get done is a dashboard for managing it all. Since this one is easy, just like setting up a proxmox server. I figured I would get it done quick.


### Enter Dashy
I was scrolling throughout GitHub, and came across Dashy. I was a bit hesitant to set it up, but after giving it a bit of time, I quickly realized how much potential it has. I then got off to working on my configuration for it more and more. The time definitely payed off, and I found even more free APIs to play around with!

### Finale
In the end, I'm really happy with the outcome I have so far, but I will definitely be posting once I get around to the next parts of my Home Lab!
