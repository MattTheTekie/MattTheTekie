You're welcome! I'm Filipe Lima and those are notes I took while studying. The experience will be much better if you read the notes [in my website](https://datsfilipe.dev/brain). The notes are messy and even might be wrong, so if you find any problems within them, please create an issue at [this repository](https://github.com/datsfilipe/brain/issues). Any constructive feedbacks or corrections are welcome. Consider this an experiment in [Learning in public](https://anaisurl.com/learning-in-public).

## How to read

If you are in my website already, use the sidebar to navigate through the notes. You might as well use the search bar to find something specific. If you are in GitHub, you can use the file tree of the repository to navigate through the notes.

Have a good read!
