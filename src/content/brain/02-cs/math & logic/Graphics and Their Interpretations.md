## 1. Interval Concepts

### 1.1. Closed Interval on Real Line

- Notation: $[a, b] = \{ x \in \mathbb{R}: a \leq x \leq b \}$

![Interval Closed on Real Line](/assets/02-02-math-closed-interval.svg)

### 1.1. Open Interval on Real Line

- Notation: $]a, b[ = \{ x \in \mathbb{R}: a < x < b \}$

### 1.1. Half-Open Real Half-Line

- Notation: $[a, +\infty[ = \{ x \in \mathbb{R}: x \geq a \}$

![Interval Closed on Real Line](/assets/02-02-math-half-open-line.svg)

### 1.1. Open Real Half-Line

- Notation: $]a, +\infty[ = \{ x \in \mathbb{R}: x > a \}$

### 1.1. Interval Amplitude

- Formula: $SL - IL$ (where $SL$ is the superior limit and $IL$ is the inferior limit)
- Amplitude will be the same independently of the interval type, open or closed.

## 2. Definitions and Characteristics of a Function

![Cartesian Plane](/assets/02-02-math-cartesian-plane.svg)

- The values that appears in the $x$ axis are the independent variable
- The values that appears in the $y$ axis are the dependent variable (depend on $x$ value).

### 2.1 Ambiguity

- Occurs when by each value of the independent variable, we have more than one value of the dependent variable.
- When this happens, we say that the cartesian plane **doesn't represent a function**.

### 2.2. Roots

- The roots of a graph are the values of the $x$ that makes the function equals to zero.
- We can have multiple roots.
- We can have no roots.
- Notation: $f(x) = 0$

### 2.3. Domain (from Wikipedia)

- It's the set of inputs accepted by the function ($dom(f)$).
- In layman's terms, the domain of a function can generally be taught as "what $x$ can be".

In the special case that **$X$ and $Y$ are both subsets of $\mathbb {R}$**, the function $f$ can be graphed in the Cartesian coordinate system.

> In this case, **the domain is represented on the x-axis of the graph**, as the projection of the graph of the function onto the x-axis.

### 2.3. Maximum and Minimum

- Notation: $f(x) > f(y) \forall y (-)$ (local maximum) and $f(x) < f(y) \forall y (-)$ (local minimum)
    - $(-)$ means interval, because we are defining maximum and minimum for a certain interval.
    - Sometimes we can assume that the minimum and maximum are global and not local.
