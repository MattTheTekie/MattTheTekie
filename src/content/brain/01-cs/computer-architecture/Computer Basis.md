## Computer Evolution

### Turing Machine

Turing machine was a forerunner of the computer.

### Computer generations

- Thermionic Valves: ENIAC was the first electronic computer in history and was developed by United States. It weights 30 tons;
- Transistors: The first transistors occupied only some milimeters, needing less energy than valves. So the computers got less big;
- Integrated Circuits: Silicon wafers that contain a miniaturized electronic circuit. It is what we commonly call a computer chip. It made possible that in 1970, personal computers started being created/used (by that came two big enterprises in this sector, Microsoft and Apple);
- Microprocessors: Videogames, LAN and Internet was the main subjects about tech in 1980. After the XX century, computers got smaller and started appearing in cars, airplanes, etc. Later, in 2010, they were already integrated in TV's and phones, called Smart TV's and smartphones.

### Today Computers

Smartphones are powerful computers nowadays. The next probable advances in technology of computers might be quantum computers, since it's been harder and harder to lower the size of transistors (that's a theory that at some point it will be just impossible to do so, so they are already preparing to advance in other ways);

## Computer System

### Hardware and Software

Hardware is the physical part and software is the logical part, they together compose the computer system.

### Main Hardware Components

- Peripherals: Where the user can communicate with the computer (like mouse, keyboard and monitor), it can send information to be processed (mouse, keyboard) or show processed information (monitor);
- RAM: Where The operation data being manipulated and the next steps (algorithms) are stored;
- Processor: Where the operations will be processed;

#### CPU

CPU clock frequency indicates the speed of the processor at executing operations. Nowadays isn't the only thing that makes a good processor, but back in past, that was the main reason that could define wether a processor is good or not.
Overclocking is the action of customizing the CPU clock to obtain higher speeds or processing, but it can damage your processor, so it is usually practiced by experienced users.
Nowadays, CPU's have cores that are microprocessors inside the processor. That technique is called multicore. Also, using only RAM can be hard for processors, because RAM speed is a lot lower than CPU speed, so a cache memory for processors was created. So, a good amount of cache memory size can speed up the processor, so it's also a good point to look at.

#### RAM (Random Access Memory)

When there's no energy, the data is deleted (volatility). There's also ROM, rom is a memory that stores the BIOS (main software of each computer).

#### Motherboard

Main motherboard components are: socket for processor, peripheral bus, sockets for RAM. Main purpose of motherboard is connect the RAM, CPU and peripherals, alongside with other not necessary components of the machine by the use of bus.

#### Secondary Memory

Since RAM is volatile, the use of memories that will not be deleted when energy is down is necessary. The most used are HD's (hard disks), because they were for most time in the market and still being used. They are slow memories that make use of a disk and other technologies to write and read memory.
Nowadays hard disks are outdated and the reason is that SSD's (solid state disks), because their size are tinier but mainly because their speed are higher. Alongside with traditional SSD, it's the SSD nvme, which goes directly on the motherboards (those that have support to) and are more faster and tinier.

### Software

- Finalistics: those that are initiated by users, like web browsers, text editors, etc;
- System: those that allow the finalistics to run. The main System Software is the Operational System.

### Operational System Paper

- Serve as an abstraction layer for between hardware and finalistics software;
- Deal with allocation of storage and RAM;
- Deal with startup functions and user preferences under programs that should be prioritize or not;
- Inform when and what programs can have access to the processor;
- Choose when programs should pass the access to the processor to another programs.

Since operational system stills a software, it needs to be loaded in memory (RAM) to be executed, that's what the BIOS (stored in ROM memory in the computer) does.

Examples of operational systems:

- Unix (1970): Just a legend;
- MS DOS (1980): What they did to you, huh?
- iOS and Android (20th Century): Obviously an W for android here;
- Windows: Garbage;
- Linux: Supremacy.

### Network Comunication with Computer Systems

In the 60's begun the idea of the web communication. ARPANET was created in the 70's by North American Defense Department. The communication was made using copper wires with communication protocols to make them understand what to talk between each other.

- Dial-up Internet: The telephone companies assumed the paper of delivering internet, so with that appeared the modem;
- IP Address and Router: The router is responsible for connecting the device that is connected in it with the world wide web (www), and to identify a device, the router address an IP (four numbers between 0 to 255 separated by dots) to each device connected;
- Search Pages, Chat Pages: With the increase of the amount of information and sites available in the www, search pages (google) alongside with chat pages/apps (like WhatsApp), became popular;
- Games: LAN was used to play games before, what made LAN Houses (local with LAN internet connecting the local computers) popular, nowadays it's possible to play games (only problem is latency) with anyone in any place in the world connected to the internet;
- Starlink: Elon Musk wants to connect the whole world with internet via satellite and provide high speeds. Isn't a thing yet, but it's promising.
