## Reason and Benefits of the Standards ISO/IEC 27001 and 27002

### ISO Standards and Information Security

ISO - International Organization for Standardization is an entity founded in 1947, headquartered in Switzerland, which brings together national standardization bodies. Basically, work standards.

ISO works alongside with International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) for electrotechnical matters.

The ISO/IEC 27000 brings principles and vocabulary that will be utilized in the standards from 27000 family.

The ISO/IEC 27001 Standard (Information Technology - Information Security Management Systems - Requirements was prepared to prove requirements for establishing, implementing, maintaining and continually improving an Information Security Management System (ISMS).

It is up to the top management of each organization to decide on the adoption of an Information Security Management System (ISMS).

**What ISO/IEC 27001 is about:**

- An internationally recognized structured methodology dedicated to information security.
- A defined process for validating, implementing, maintaining and managing information security.
- A detailed set of controls comprised of information security best practices.
- Developed by companies for companies.

**What it isn't about:**

- A technical standard.
- A driven product or technology.
- An equipment evaluation methodology.
- But it may require the use of equipment warranty levels.

The version of the ISO/IEC 27001 being used here is from 2013 and is the most recent (when these studies were made). A new thing about the update in the rule from 2005 to 2013 is the alignment with the L attachment.

**L attachment high level structure**:

- Clause 1: Scope;
- Clause 2: Normative reference;
- Clause 3: Terms and definitions;
- Clause 4: Context of the organization;
- Clause 5: Leadership;
- Clause 6: Planning;
- Clause 7: Support;
- Clause 8: Transaction;
- Clause 9: Performance Assessment;
- Clause 10: Improvement.

Some reasons to adopt the standard include:

- Improved effectiveness of Information Security;
- Market differentiation;
- Satisfy customers' requirements;
- Single standard with global acceptance;
- Responsibilities focused on the work team;
- Information Technology covers standards as well as organization, personnel and facilities;
- Commands and laws.

The ISO/IEC 27001 Standard is subject to accredited certification. Some benefits of ISO/IEC 27001 certification include:

- Reduced liability due to policies and procedures not implemented or enforced;
- Opportunity to identify and eliminate weaknesses;
- Management participates in Information Security;
- Independent review of your ISMS;
- Provides security to all interested parties;
- Improved security awareness;
- Merge features with other management systems;
- Mechanism for measuring the success of the system.

**About certificates:**

- Certificate: The document emitted by an organism of certification;
- Site: Permanent local where an organization realizes a job or service.

The ABNT NBR ISO/IEC 27002:2013 Standard presents the best practices to be used in information security management. Its title is Code of Practice for Information Security Management.

> The 2013 version recommends 114 types of basic controls.

Each main section contains:

- A control objective stating what is expected to be achieved;
- One or more controls that can be applied to achieve the control objective.

Control definitions are structured in this way:

**Control:**

> Defines the specific declaration of the control, to fulfill the control objective. According to ISO/IEC 27000 (2018), control is a measure that can modify the risk, whether through a process, policy, device, practice or other actions that modify the threat and/or vulnerability and, consequently, the risk.

**Guidelines for Implementation:**

> Presents more detailed information to support implementation of the control and achieving the control objective. The guidelines may not be fully adequate or sufficient in all situations and may therefore not fully meet an organization's specific control requirements.

**Additional Information:**

> It presents more data that can be considered, such as legal issues and normative references. If there is no additional information, this part is not shown in the control.

Two words for both of the standards that are used a lot in them and become their memorable characteristic:

- For 27001 the word is: MUST;
- FOr 27002 the word is: SUITS (not talking about clothes).
