## Vulnerability, Threat, and Attacks

### Company Assets

Every company has assets that are valuable to the company. These assets can be physical, intellectual, or financial. The company needs to protect these assets from threats and attacks.

- **Information Assets**: The company's information assets are the company's data, software, contracts, and other information.
- **Software Assets**: The company's software assets are the company's software, source code, and other software.
- **Physical Assets**: The company's physical assets are the company's buildings, equipment, and other physical items.
- **Services**: Electricity, refrigeration, and other services are the company's services.
- **People**: Qualifications, skills and experience.
- **Intangible Assets**: The company's intangible assets are the company's brand, reputation, and other intangible items.

### Threats

Threats are the potential for harm to the company's assets. Threats can be internal or external. Threats can be intentional or unintentional. But we can also divide threats into logical and physical.

- **Logical Threats**: Logical threats are threats that are caused by the company's information assets. For example, a virus that infects the company's computers is a logical threat.
- **Physical Threats**: Physical threats are threats that to company's physical assets. For example, a fire that destroys the company's building is a physical threat.

### Controls

Controls are the company's actions to protect the company's assets from threats. Controls can be physical or logical. Controls can be preventative or detective. Controls can be manual or automated.

| Threats | Vulnerabilities | Control measures |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Logic | Operating system issues; Application failures; Dangerous web sites. | Antivirus installation; Firewall; Access control list; Operating system update. |
| Physics | Lack of identification of visitors to the company; Loose wires; Data center room accessible to anyone. | Installation of security cameras; Access to the room by biometric control; Raised floor against floods; lightning rod; UPS. |

### Incident

An incident occurs when company's controls do not cover all the vulnerabilities, and then those are explored.

### Event

An event is an incident that has been detected, and do not compromise the company.

### Impact x Risk

Impact is the damage that an incident can cause to the company. Risk is the combination of consequences of an event/incident (including changes in circumstances) and it's probability of occurrence.

### Risk Management Systems (RMS)

This is the set of practices and procedures used to manage risks.

### Information Security Management System (ISMS)

According to the ABNT NBR ISO/IEC 27001 standard, the information security risk management process must meet the requirements of an ISMS.

### Resume

To end this learning stage, we will present a summary of terms and definitions related to information security.

1. **Control**:

(ISO/IEC 27000:2018, item 3.14) - Measure that can modify the risk through a process, policy, device, practice or other actions that modify the threat and/or vulnerability â€“ and, consequently, the risk.

2. **Threat**:

(ISO/IEC 27000:2018, item 3.74) - Potential cause of an unwanted incident, which could result in damage to a system or an organization through security breach.

3. **Vulnerability**:

(ISO/IEC 27000:2018, item 3.77) - Fragility of an asset or group of assets that can be exploited by one or more threats and, consequently, compromise the security of systems or information.

4. **Vulnerability analysis**:

Process of raising faults or absences in a set of protections.

5. **Vulnerability assessment**:

Combination of analysis and a list of threats to assess how likely they are to occur.

6. **Information security event**:

(ISO/IEC 27000:2018, item 3.30) - Identified occurrence of a network, service or system state that indicates a possible failure of the security policy or safeguards, or even a hitherto unknown situation that may become relevant in terms of security.

7. **Information security incident**:

(ISO/IEC 27000:2018, item 3.31) - An unwanted or unexpected event or series of events that is likely to compromise the company's operations or threaten information security.

8. **Risk**:

(ISO/IEC 27000:2018, item 3.61) - Combination of the consequences of an event (including changes in circumstances) and its associated probability of occurrence.

9. **Impact**:

Undesirable change in business objectives.

10. **Asset Scope**:

Defines the set of assets covered by the process.

11. **Party involved**:

Individuals, groups or organizations directly affected by a risk.

12. **Interested party**:

Individual or group with an interest in the performance or success of an organization.

## Risk Management Process

### Information Security Risk

we need to understand how risk management (RM) processes are carried out within Information Security Management (GSI). For this, we will analyze an example.

The XPTO organization has a server running a database with the following elements:

- Asset scope: Server and database.
- Identified vulnerabilities: Flaw in the software that can be exploited due to another flaw in the operating system.
- Threat: Malware coded to exploit the aforementioned vulnerabilities and steal database data.
- Control measure adopted: Installation of an antivirus suite.
- Control measures not adopted: Operating system and software update.
- Possible information security incident: Malware arrives via email to a user, who executes the attached file.
- Impacts: Theft of sensitive data and financial loss.
- Risk: Extreme risk.

### Risk Management

- **Concept**: Risk management is the process that systematically and continuously identifies and deals with risks. It is one of the most important components of the GSI.
- **Functionality**: To be successful, GR must be permanent, showing itself capable of identifying new vulnerabilities and threats that can affect the three pillars of information security: confidentiality, integrity and availability (CID).

### Risk Assessment

Risk assessment is the process of identifying, analyzing and evaluating the risks that threaten the organization's assets. Measuring their impact and probability of occurrence.

Also, after the first step, the organization must decide how to deal with the risks identified. There are four ways to deal with risks:

- **Accept**: Accept the risk.
- **Mitigate**: Reduce the impact.
- **Transfer**: Transfer the risk to another party (insurance, etc.).
- **Avoid**: Eliminate the risk.

### Control or protection measures

Control or protection measures can be classified as:

- **Preventive**: Prevents incidents from occurring.
- **Discouraging**: Discourages the practice of actions.
- **Monitor**: Monitors status and operation.
- **Remedial**: Fixes existing crashes.
- **Recoverer**: Repairs damage caused by incidents.
- **Reactive**: Reacts to certain incidents.
- **Detector**: Detects the occurrence of incidents.
- **Limiter**: Decreases the damage done.

### GRC (Governance, Risk and Compliance)

GRC is a set of practices and procedures that allow the organization to manage risks and comply with laws and regulations.

- **Governance**: The set of practices and procedures that allow the organization to manage risks.
- **Risk**: The combination of the consequences of an event (including changes in circumstances) and its associated probability of occurrence.
- **Compliance**: The set of practices and procedures that allow the organization to comply with laws and regulations.
