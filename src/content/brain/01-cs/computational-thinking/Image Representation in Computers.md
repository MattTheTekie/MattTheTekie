## Pixel Fundaments

Basically every image is composed by pixels. Pixels are colored visual squares. The amount of pixels tells the resolution of the media.

## RGB Scheme

Newton Prism as the experiment of Isaac Newton to demonstrate that light, when passing by a prisma, can be divided in a lot of colors, exactly how it happen with rainbow. That experiment showed that white light isn't pure and indivisible.

From those colors, we call green, red and blue 'constituent colors', because they can be used to recreate other colors, even the white light. And that's how computers pixels get colored, it's by using RGB scheme.
