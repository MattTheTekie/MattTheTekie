## Essential Equation of Computers

### Fundamental Equation

Computer = Absolute Capacity of Processing * Terrible Capacity of Thinking;

*Obs: Clearly the guys didn't saw chatGPT in action!*

It's essential to know what computers can do and cannot. Nowadays, even if the professional isn't in some technology role, technology is everywhere in work places.

Since some people are too engaged in technology and others are doing their first steps, some institutions had gave up on the use of technology, which just increased the segregation.

So the main key here is that everyone can understand how a computer works. They're powerful, since they can make billions of operations per second and can generate data in an absurd speed, but in other hand the calculations they can make are simple, they can't do complex operations on their own.

### Human Versus Machine

Even about artificial intelligence, the thing remains: the computer has the ability to carry out actions based on a defined logical sequence, with a set of variations and high speeds, as the storage and processing capacities are expanded. On the other hand, if the commands are not established, if the parameters are not arranged and structured, the machine reaches a limit.

## Exploration Process of Computers Potential

### Between Codes and Algorithms: Learning Computers Logic

Every computer needs initial instructions and/or parameters in order to execute something.

#### Code

The code is a bunch of instructions written in order to make the computer execute something. Those instructions will be very simple if you take piece by piece of their execution, but the point in here is the logic the programmer uses to write the instruction. With the right lines of code is possible to make the computer execute very hard and complex logic.

So the programmers are the ones who make possible for the computers to execute hard and complex tasks. The programmers are the intermediate between the demand of human needs (laugh, travel, etc) and the computer inability of doing tasks by themselves, needing code/instructions to do so.

#### Algorithm

The algorithm is nothing more then the result of the sequencing of comprehensive instructions for to realize a task.

Let's suppose you thought about an algorithm that can calculate the average age in offices in Seattle, then you started creating your code in order to be executed and achieve the desired solution. Until the code does what it is supposed to do, it's not an algorithm.

### How Computers Evolve

#### Moore Law

Moore was defending that the computers would be smaller and smaller while the time passes, because the amount of components onto integrated circuits would be increasing since they would be smaller and smaller (2x smaller by year). So in near 6/7 years (from now, 2023), we would be reaching the limit of decreasing the size of those components, meaning we should have another ways to improve computers capacity.

By this law, the evolution of computers turns out decreasing their prices, making them more accessible.
