## Computational Thinking

Computational thinking is the step that precedes programming. It is the process of elaborating the instructions that the machine will receive in order to produce a solution.

### The 4 Pillars of Computational Thinking

- Decomposition
- Pattern Recognition
- Abstraction
- Algorithm Design

#### Decomposition

Decomposition is the process of breaking down a problem into smaller parts. This is the first step in the process of solving a problem.

#### Pattern Recognition

Pattern recognition is the process of identifying patterns in a problem. This is the second step in the process of solving a problem. The objective is to reuse solutions that had worked in the past for newer problems that are sufficiently similar.

#### Abstraction

Abstraction is the process of identifying the essential features of a problem. This is the third step in the process of solving a problem. The objective is to ignore information and details that are not useful to elaborate a solution.

#### Algorithm Design

Algorithm design is the process of elaborating the instructions that the machine will receive in order to produce a solution. This is the fourth step in the process of solving a problem. This step is important because automating tasks has became an important thing in the current world, and it can be made through algorithms.

### Work Market

Computational thinking is included into ***soft skills***. This means that it is not a technical skill, but it is a skill that is useful to work in the industry. It is highly used not just into tech jobs but also in the majority of jobs nowadays.

## Computational Thinking In Creative Economy And Business

### Creative Economy

It is a new concept that is being used to describe the new economy that is being created by the digital revolution. It is a new economy that is based on the creation of new products and services, and it is based on the creation of new ways to produce and distribute products and services.

Computational thinking is used in the creative economy to create new products and services, and to create new ways to produce and distribute products and services, like softwares, games and other digital produce.

### Business

Independent of the industry, technology is being used to automate tasks and to improve the client experience. The concern about efficiency, resilience and security is directly related to technology.

A good example of how important technology is for business nowadays is that Blockbuster, a company that was the biggest video rental company in the world, went bankrupt because it did not adapt to the new technology. While Netflix became the biggest streaming platform in the world.

Like media and entertainment services, various other industries are being disrupted by technology. Nowadays even banks can be accessed and used by a software in a smartphone.

Even monetary transactions got recently impacted by technology with the creation of cryptocurrencies, and a lot of other ways to make transactions with facial recognition, approximation and qr codes.

## Computational Thinking In Education

"The insertion of computational thinking in school is not only aimed at employability, competitiveness and economic growth, but mainly at building competences and skills that are fundamental to human beings for the effective exercise of citizenship in a digital society." - Blikstein, 2008, n. p.
