## What Is It?

Hardware is basically the physical part of a computer. Meaning it comprehends the components: GPU, CPU, Coolers, Motherboard, USB Hub's, RAM memory cards, SSD's, HD's, removable media, peripherals, etc.

In a comparison, as an analogy, you can think about the difference between hardware and software as the difference between body and soul, respectively.

Another analogy with different purpose is: CPU is the brain and transistors are the neurons. Transistors, one of the biggest inventions of the century, are embedded into components called chips. For an example, Intel Core i9 9900k contains 12 billions of transistors.

### Moore Law

Basically it just states that the industry is being able to double the number of transistors embedded into a chip, which means more performance and less cost. It isn't exactly a law but okay.

Smartphones nowadays are a lot faster than the computer used for trajectory calculation at Apollo XI. An international accepted way for measuring the performance power of a computer is the **FLOPS** (Floating-point operations per second).

## Basic Components of Hardware

The fundamental ones are:

- CPU;
- RAM;
- Persisted Memory: SSD's, HD's, SD Cards, etc. By itself, those memories aren't ready for use, so they need something called file system. There is a lot of file systems out there and a lot of softwares for applying file systems into those devices, being it entirely or only for a partition;
- Motherboard: Is responsible for connecting all the electronic components.

### Microcontroller

A small computer built on a single chip is known as a microcontroller, which has all the basic components like CPU, RAM and persistent storage on a really small scale. Logically, its computational power, when compared to desktop computers, is quite limited.

Examples of equipments that make use of microcontrollers are: cars, thermostats and microwaves. Another good example of microcontroller is an arduino.

## Data Storage Units

- 1B (byte) = 1 byte (one);
- 1KB (kilobyte) = 1024 bytes or ≃ 1.000 bytes (thousand);
- 1MB (megabyte) = 1024 kilobytes or ≃ 1.000.000 bytes (million);
- 1GB (gigabyte) = 1024 megabytes or ≃ 1.000.000.000 bytes (billion);
- 1TB (terabyte) = 1024 gigabytes or ≃ 1.000.000.000.000 bytes (trillion);
- 1PB (petabyte) = 1024 terabytes or ≃ 1.000.000.000.000.000 bytes (quadrillion);
- 1EB (exabyte) = 1024 petabytes or ≃ 1.000.000.000.000.000.000 bytes (quintillion);
- 1ZB (zettabyte) = 1024 exabytes or ≃ 1.000.000.000.000.000.000.000 bytes (sextillion);
- 1YB (yottabyte) = 1024 zettabytes or ≃ 1.000.000.000.000.000.000.000.000 bytes (septillion).

### Bits and Bytes

Basically bits are only 0's or 1's, and a group of 8 bits is equal to one byte.

Any group of bits have a number of possible combinations. 2 bits have four combinations possible, while 1 bit just have 2. This means that n (combinations) is equal to 2 elevated to x (where x is the number of bits). That said, a byte has 256 possible combinations of bits.

That said, a byte can represent numbers (from 0-255). A good example of this is the representation of colors in computers, where red, green and blue are represented in computer memory as one byte each. So, in RGB standard we have 256 distinct levels of red, 256 distinct levels of green and 256 distinct levels blue. Using that standard the computer can represents 256x256x256 = 16,777,216 colors (16.77 million colors).
