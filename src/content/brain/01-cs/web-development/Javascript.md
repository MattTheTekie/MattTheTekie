## Concepts and Syntax of Javascript

It's an **interpreted** and **multi paradigm** language, since it has support for structured, object oriented and functional programming. It was developed to be used on client side, but nowadays it can be used on server side and also for building mobile apps.

### DOM Tree

DOM (Document Object Model) is an interface that allows the manipulation, via programming, of HTML (XML, others) documents.

With Javascript it is possible to add, modify (styles for example), and even manipulate events on DOM elements at execution time. Those modifications are dynamic, but it isn't persistent, which means the initial state is what remains when user left the page.

### Javascript in HTML

Can be done by `<script>` tag or by adding an external archive with `.js` extension.

*Note: XMLHttpRequest is an old interface for making asynchronous requests in js, before `fetch`. And AJAX stands for Asynchronous JAvascript and XML.*
