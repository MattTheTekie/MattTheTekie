## Basic Concepts of PHP

PHP is an script open source language. PHP basically generates HTML on the server and ships it to the client, meaning PHP executes on server and it only cares about what happens in server, anything till the point it goes to the client is not a concern of PHP anymore, different of something like `Next.js` nowadays that cares about the entire cycle.

- 'print_r': The “print_r” function prints the elements of an array;
- 'count': The “count” function returns the size (number of elements) of an array. This function is also very useful when working with vectors;
- 'unset': The “unset” function receives as a parameter the array and index or indexes that we want to remove. In addition, it is also possible to remove the entire vector, passing it as a parameter and without defining any index;
- 'array_splice': The “array_splice” function receives as parameters the array to be manipulated, the offset (index from which we want to delete elements) and the length (number of items we want to delete).

**Multidimensional arrays** are just array that in their **indexes** have other arrays declared.
